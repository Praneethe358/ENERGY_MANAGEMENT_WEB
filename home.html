    <h2 class="pad">RENEWABLE RESOURCES</h2>
    <p>Renewable resources are natural resources that are replenished naturally over time and can be used repeatedly without depleting them. These resources are sustainable and have a smaller environmental footprint compared to non-renewable resources like fossil fuels. Some common types of renewable resources include:</p>
    <p>1.SOLAR ENERGY: Energy derived from the sun. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity and are a major source of renewable energy.</p><table>
     <p>2.WIND ENERGY: Wind turbines harness wind to generate electricity. Wind is abundant and can be used continuously as long as there are wind currents.</p> 
     <P>3.HYDRO POWER: Also known as hydroelectric power, this energy comes from the movement of water, typically from rivers, dams, or tides, to generate electricity.</P>

    <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY</h2>
<P>Fossil fuel energy refers to the energy derived from fossil fuels, which are non-renewable natural resources formed over millions of years from the remains of ancient plants and animals. These fuels are burned to produce energy in the form of electricity, heat, and mechanical power. The three main types of fossil fuels are:</P>
 <P> 1.COAL 
    FORMATION: Coal is formed from plant remains that accumulate in swampy, low-oxygen environments. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turn these remains into peat, then into lignite, bituminous coal, and finally anthracite coal.</P>
<p>2. OIL(PETROL)
    Formation: Oil is formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms (like plankton) that get buried under layers of sediment. Over time, heat and pressure transform these remains into crude oil.</p>
<p>3. NATURAL GAS FORMATION: Natural gas is primarily composed of methane and forms in similar conditions to oil but generally at higher temperatures and pressures. It is often found in the same geological formations as oil.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">NUCLEAR ENERGY</h2>
<p>Nuclear energy is the energy released from the nucleus of atoms through nuclear reactions, typically either nuclear fission or nuclear fusion. It is considered a powerful energy source and plays a significant role in the global energy mix, particularly for electricity generation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of nuclear energy:</p>
<p>1. NUCLEAR FISSION
    How it Works: Nuclear fission is the process by which the nucleus of a heavy atom, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, is split into smaller nuclei when it absorbs a neutron. This splitting releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat, which is then used to produce electricity.</p>
<p>2. NUCLEAR FUSSION (Still Developing)
    How it Works: Fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei, usually isotopes of hydrogen (like deuterium and tritium), combine to form a heavier nucleus. This releases an enormous amount of energy, similar to the process that powers the sun.</p>
<p>NEW REACTOR DESIGN: Advanced reactor designs, like small modular reactors (SMRs), are being developed to be more cost-effective, safer, and flexible than traditional large reactors. These smaller reactors may be easier to deploy in different regions and help address some of the concerns about nuclear energy.</p>
